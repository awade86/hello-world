# hello-world

Hello everyone,
my name is Acami. I am new to programming. I have no skills or knowledge about any of this and am starting from scratch. May 1, I will be starting school online for mobile development and just looking at this tutorial I am wondering how it will be. Im feeling a little scared I will not catch on. On the other hand i am excited about my new venture. I am a mother of two and am trying to start my own business. Hopeing everything works out this year.
